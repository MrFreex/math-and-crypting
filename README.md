## ⚠ This is not a professional website, it's a school project! ⚠

This website was made to fullfill a school assignment in a more creative way. The base goal was to make a research about criptography using mainly the resources found on KanAcademy.

We decided to do something newer, related to our school studies: IT.

It is now available to everyone and open source! Enjoy knowing how we built it.

P.S. : The "base.js" source code was taken from this repo: https://github.com/denysdovhan/rsa-labwork
